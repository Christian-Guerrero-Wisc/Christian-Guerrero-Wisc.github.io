				<p>
					I have been doing martial arts since my Junior year of high school.
					I started with Kickboxing and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) at a local gym
					in Saipan. I have been doing martial arts for almost 4 years now and I will continue
					to do it for as long as I can. I have made many friends through martial arts
					and I have learned a lot about myself and others. I started martial arts because
					I could not find a ball or team sport that I enjoyed or have been good at. I never
					really had playing time in those high school teams since I was not as good as others
					so I got bored easily, but with martial arts, I am never bored and always getting action.
					I recommend anyone with any athletic ability or skill to get into it because it teaches you
					endurance, tenacity, and how to push yourself through pain and discomfort.
