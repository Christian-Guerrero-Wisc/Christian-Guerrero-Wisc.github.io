			<p> My name is Christian Guerrero, born 2004. I am from the island of Saipan
				in the Northern Mariana Islands, a United States Territory.
				I was born and raised there, and I am currently a student at
				the University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in Information Science.
				When I am not spending time studying, I enjoy playing video games
				(specifically first person shooters, RPGs, and story-driven adventure
				titles), watching Regular Show, and going out with my friends and
				my younger brother Ruben, who is a freshman at UW-Madison as well.
